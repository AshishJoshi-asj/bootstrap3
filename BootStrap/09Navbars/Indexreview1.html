Training is the acquisition of                                                      knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge that
                   relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity
                   and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology 
                   (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade,occupation or profession,
                   observers of the labor-market recognize as of 2008 the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications: to maintain, upgrade and update                              skills throughout working life. People within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as                                                         professional development.</p>

                I feel really thankful to training team for giving me an opportunity to be trained by some of the best professionals of a
                 Infogain in software and technology. Having completed my training in Responsive Web Design, I feel confident and well-versed
                 in this technology because of the efficient lecture and training provided. 
                The presentations were concise and covered all the concepts required in today’s competent corporate environment. 
                Quality of assignments and projects provided an add-on in terms of hands-on experience. 
                Affordability and Quality is what sets this training apart. Therefore, I would recommend students to undergo this experience. </p>
