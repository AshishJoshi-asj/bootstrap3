                   <em>Learning and Development</em> Department believe in providing avenues of learning to all individuals at 
                   the organization and align individual competencies with organizational objectives.
The <strong>team</strong> provides need-based,
                   timely and holistic learning solutions at the individual, team and organizational level. Training is the acquisition of                                                      knowledge, skills, and competencies as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge that
                   relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity
                   and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology 
                   (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade,occupation or profession,
                   observers of the labor-market recognize as of 2008 the need to continue training beyond initial qualifications: to maintain, upgrade and update                              skills throughout working life. People within many professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as                                                         professional development.       The training solutions are 
                   driven by the goals and needs of the employees.
                    The training need of an employee is determined from the Quarterly Training Plan received from Training Cabinets,
                    Project Managers individual team specific needs, Individual training requirements from TNI.
              
                I feel really thankful to training team for giving me an opportunity to be trained by some of the best professionals of a
                 Infogain in software and technology. Having completed my training in Responsive Web Design, I feel confident and well-versed
                 in this technology because of the efficient lecture and training provided. 
                The presentations were concise and covered all the concepts required in today’s competent corporate environment. 
                Quality of assignments and projects provided an add-on in terms of hands-on experience. 
                Affordability and Quality is what sets this training apart. Therefore, I would recommend students to undergo this experience.

                         <p>A timer is a specialized type of clock for measuring time intervals.[1] A timer which counts upwards from zero for measuring elapsed time is often called a stopwatch; a device which counts down from a specified time interval is more usually called a timer. A simple example is an hourglass. Some timers sound an audible indication that the time interval has expired. Time switches, timing mechanisms which activate a switch, are sometimes called "timers".</p>

                         <p>A pen (Latin: penna, feather) is a writing implement used to apply ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. Historically, reed pens, quill pens, and dip pens were used, with a nib dipped in ink. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used. Modern types also include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain, and felt or ceramic tip pens</p>

It consists of a book or binder composed of pages, often ruled, made out of paper, used for purposes including recording notes or memoranda, writing, drawing, and scrapbooking.</p>
